# SharePoint Framework Remove Component

This Visual Studio Code extension is intended to easily remove SharePoint Framework components from the current project you are working on. Normally when you want to remove a component, you will also have to do some manual changes to the config file of your project. This extension eliminates this task, so you can get back to developing much quicker.
